## Response
This museum archives and exhibits behaviors, practices and artitfacts that are considered "kink" These kinks subvert and dismantle the rigid structure of sexuality and encourage exploration of sexual behavior.

## Mexican Museum of Art

Mission statement

"To stimulate knowledge and appreciation of Mexican art and culture from both sides of the border through a significant permanent collection of Mexican art, rich visual and performing arts programs, high quality arts education programs and resources and professional development of Mexican artists.
